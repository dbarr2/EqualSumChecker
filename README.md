# Equal Sum Checker in Java

Welcome to the Equal Sum Checker project. This Java application is a straightforward yet effective tool for determining whether the sum of two numbers equals a third number. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this program showcases the use of arithmetic operations and conditional logic in Java.

## Overview

The Equal Sum Checker takes three parameters as input and checks if the addition of the first two equals the third. This functionality is encapsulated in a single method, making it an excellent example of basic Java programming concepts, including method definition, parameters, return values, and boolean logic.

## Features

- **Simple Input and Output**: Accepts three integer parameters and returns a boolean result.
- **Clear Logic Implementation**: Employs basic arithmetic and comparison operations for a straightforward purpose.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Can be utilized in various applications where such a conditional check is needed.

## Implementation

The core of the Equal Sum Checker is a method that takes three integers as arguments. It then checks if the sum of the first two integers equals the third integer. The method returns `true` if they are equal, otherwise `false`.
